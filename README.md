# Weather-App-using-python-API
a software application that retrieves real-time weather data from a weather service's Application Programming Interface (API)
to display current conditions, forecasts, and other relevant weather information for a specific location, 
allowing users to access detailed weather details by simply inputting a city name or using their device's geolocation capabilities; 
popular weather APIs include OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, and Tomorrow.io,
where developers can access weather data by making API calls with their unique API key to get the information needed for their app.

# Key points about weather apps using APIs:
# API Integration:
The core functionality is to connect to a weather API using code to fetch weather data based on user input (like city name). 
# Data Display:
The app then presents the retrieved weather details in a user-friendly format, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, 
weather conditions (like sunny, cloudy, rainy), and forecasts for the coming days. 
# API Key Requirement:
To access weather data, developers need to sign up for an API provider and obtain a unique API key that is used in the API calls
